# MWS Feeds

**MWS Feeds** is a Ruby interface to the [Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) Feeds API](http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/feeds/index.html). With the MWS Feeds API, you can build applications that let sellers purchase shipping for non-Prime and Prime orders using Amazonâ€™s Buy Shipping Services.

(To use Amazon MWS, you must have an Amazon MWS developer account.)

## Usage

Create a client:

```ruby
require "mws-feeds"
client = MWS.feeds(marketplace: "ATVPDKIKX0DER", merchant_id: "123")
```

Set up credentials [when instantiating or with environment variables](https://github.com/hakanensari/peddler#usage).

### Feed Submission Count

Get the count of feeds submitted in the past 90 days:

```ruby
response = client.get_feed_submission_count
submission_count_data = response.parse
puts submission_count_data.count # => 1
```
